This script extracts values for ammonia, temperature, and pH measurements from an environmental report needed for on-going monitoring at regional and state levels. A busy environmental scientist would manually sort and filter an Excel file and extract the values, a less-than-ideal task for someone with their background and skills.

Based on a back of the envelope calculation, this script will <span style="color: magenta;">**save 80 hours of work per year**</span>. Allowing the scientist to focus their time and energy on more impactful and essential monitoring and protection efforts.

*Note*: The script is limited to the standard library to minimize installations for a non-Pythonista end user.

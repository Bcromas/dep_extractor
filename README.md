This script extracts values for ammonia, temperature, and pH measurements in a given environmental report which are needed for on-going environmental monitoring at regional and state levels. 

Normally, a busy environmental scientist would manually sort through a number of Excel files and extract the values; a tiring and less-than-ideal task for someone with their background and skills.

After a back of the envelope calculation, it was determined this script would save the scientist approximately 80 hours of work per year allowing them to focus their time and energy on more impactful and essential monitoring and protection efforts.
